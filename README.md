# Interest in IT
I have always been interested in IT from a very early age when my 2 brother and I got a C64 when I was about 6 and was amazaed on how fun it was and i thought one day i want to make something like this.

![C64](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95410193/146530320-f25a0011-f5f0-48e4-87ec-a634aa8f2e21.jpg)

Why I chose RMIT, one day i want to move to Japan and they look more favorably on what university you when to so why not chose one of the best in Australia for IT.

I hope to learn programming and hardware development
