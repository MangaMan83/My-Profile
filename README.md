To me these results are highly inacurate other then the Introverted, as a perfectionist i am very observent as i like to do think once as i dont like doing things a second time when i could do it right the first time and i am also a very creative thinker as a im always coming up with new idea's.

As being a introvert i am not that talkitive until i get to know someone, and being a perfectionist i alway look for faults and bring them up when i find them no matter how small.

When forming a team i need to take into account not everyone thinks and acts the same.
